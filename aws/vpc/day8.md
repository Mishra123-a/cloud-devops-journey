## Why VPC Exists

Before VPC, AWS customers had very limited control over networking.  
Instances were launched into shared infrastructure with minimal isolation and customization.

VPC was introduced to solve the following problems:
- Lack of network isolation
- No control over IP address ranges
- No control over routing and internet access
- Difficulty designing secure architectures

A VPC allows customers to build a **private, isolated network inside AWS**, similar to a traditional data center network.
